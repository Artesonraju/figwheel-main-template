# figwheel-template

A template generator that will produce a minimal ClojureScript project
that includes
[figwheel.main](https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel/figwheel-main)
tooling.

## Usage

Make sure you have either [Leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen) or [clj-new](https://github.com/seancorfield/clj-new) installed

#### Using lein

Make sure you have the [latest version of Leiningen installed](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen#installation).

    lein new figwheel-main hello-world.app -- --reagent
	
#### Using clj-new

Make sure you have installed `clj-new` as detailed [here](https://github.com/seancorfield/clj-new#getting-started) 
	
	clj -A:new figwheel-main hello-world.app --reagent

### Options

Takes a **name** and possibly a single **framework** option with the
form `--framework` and any number of **attribute** options of the form
`+attribute` and produces a minimal ClojureScript project that
includes Figwheel Main tooling

The framework options are:

     --react   which adds a minimal React/Sablono application in core.cljs
     --reagent which adds a minimal Reagent application in core.cljs
     --rum     which adds a minimal Rum application in core.cljs
     --om      which adds a minimal Om application in core.cljs

The attribute options are:

     +deps        which generates a deps.edn (a default when used with clj-new)
     +lein        which generates a project.clj (a default when used with lein)
     +bare-index  which generates an index without any annoyingly helpful content

Only one **framework** option can be specified at a time. If no
framework option is specified, nothing but a print statment is added
to the generated ClojureScript code.

Examples:

	lein new figwheel-main hello-world.app -- --react +deps

    clj -A:new figwheel-main hello-world.app --react +bare-index +lein

## Usage with CLI tools

To get an interactive development environment change into the project
root (the directory just created) and execute:

    clojure -Afig:build
	
After the compilation process is complete, and a browser has popped loaded the
compiled project in your browser you will get a ClojureScript REPL
prompt that is connected to the browser.

An easy way to verify this is:

    cljs.user=> (js/alert "Am I connected?")

and you should see an alert in the browser window.

You can also supply argumetns to `figwheel.main` like so:

	clojure -Afig -b dev -r

To clean all compiled files:

    rm -rf target/public

To create a production build:

	rm -rf target/public
    clojure -Afig:min
	
## Usage with Leiningen

To get an interactive development environment change into the project
root (the directory just created) and execute:

    lein fig:build
	
After the compilation process is complete, and a browser has popped loaded the
compiled project in your browser you will get a ClojureScript REPL
prompt that is connected to the browser.

An easy way to verify this is:

    cljs.user=> (js/alert "Am I connected?")

and you should see an alert in the browser window.

You can also supply argumetns to `figwheel.main` like so:

	lein fig -- -b dev -r

To clean all compiled files:

	lein clean

To create a production build:

	lein clean
    lein fig:min
